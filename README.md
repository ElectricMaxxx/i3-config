# My i3 configuration

This is my configuration for the tilling windowmanager [i3](https://i3wm.org/).

To use it just copy `config.dit` into your `~/.i3/config`. Configure your screens and 
monitors. You can alo use the `monitor-mode.sh` script. Simply copy it next to your config file
and adjust the displays you expect to connect to you symstem (hint: `xrandr` is your friend).
